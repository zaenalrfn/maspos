        DB_PORT=3306
        DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
        DB_USERNAME=your_database_username

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

(Detailed API documentation would reside here if the project had an API.)

**Example - Accessing a Category Page:**

After setup, navigate to the category page in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/categories`). The `CategoryPage/Columns.ts` file defines the structure and data display for this page. The `Category` interface dictates the type of data displayed, including `id`, `name`, `products_count`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

## Configuration Options

-   **.env file:** This file is the primary configuration source. You can adjust database settings, application name, debugging mode, and other environment-specific variables.
-   **config/app.php:** This file contains application-wide configuration settings, such as timezone, locale, and providers.
-   **config/database.php:** Defines database connections and configurations.
